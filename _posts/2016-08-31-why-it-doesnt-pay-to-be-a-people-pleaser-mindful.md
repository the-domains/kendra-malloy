  People ask me all the time what the secret to happiness is. "If you had to
  pick just one thing," they wonder, "what would be the most important thing for
  leading a happy life?" Ten years ago, I would have told you a regular
  gratitude practice was the most important thing-and while that is still my
  favorite instant happiness booster, my answer has changed.
