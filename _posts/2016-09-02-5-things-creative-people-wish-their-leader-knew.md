  If you experience a little misgiving at hiring, collaborating or managing a
  "creative-type," chances are you don't self identify as "creative." You might
  find creatives flighty or mystifying... but, trust us, you need each other. A

  between a self-identified "creative" and "not creative" an enriching, mutually
  refueling experience.
